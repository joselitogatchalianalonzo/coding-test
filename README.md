Function : Matches the subtext against the text, outputting the character positions of the beginning of each match for the subtext within the text.

Notes:
1. I used zero-based index, hence the first character is zero not 1.
2. Main Text is limited to 600 characters.
3. Sub Text is limited to 100 characters.
